    title: 'Diana of Versailles',
    about:
      'Diana is represented at the hunt, hastening forward, as if in pursuit of game. She looks toward the right and with raised right arm is about to draw an arrow from her quiver. Her left arm has been restored, and a deer has been added at her feet, although one might have expected a dog.[4] Her left hand is holding a small cylindrical fragment, which may be part of what was once a bow. She wears a short Dorian chiton, a himation around her waist, and sandals.',

    title: "Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss",
    about:
      "Having been recently awakened, Psyche reaches up towards her lover, Cupid, as he gently holds her by supporting her head and breast. Antonio Canova's fine technique in carving marble contrasts their realistic smooth skin with the surrounding elements. Loosely draped around Psyche’s lower body, a sheet further emphasizes the difference between the texture of skin and drapery. Rough texture provides the basis of the rock upon which the composition is placed supplementing the distinctions of elements.",

    title: 'Mona Lisa',
    about: `She Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many
    Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at
    that time seen as an ideal for womanhood.[29] The
    woman sits markedly upright in a "pozzetto" armchair
    with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture.
    Her gaze is fixed on the observer. The woman appears
    alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by
    his method of not drawing outlines (sfumato). The soft
    blending creates an ambiguous mood "mainly in two
    features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of
    the eyes".`,

    about: `Les premières œuvres d’art islamique sont entrées au
    Louvre à sa création en 1793. Les premières salles
    datent de 1893. À l’époque on appelait cet art «les
    arts musulmans». Ces appellations renvoient non pas à
    un art religieux, mais aux territoires orientaux et
    africains de culture principalement islamique. Cette
    collection s’enrichit énormément au cours du 19e
    siècle et du 20e siècle à l’époque où Paris est la
    place mondiale du goût orientaliste. Le Louvre a
    présenté ces collections d’abord au sein du
    département des Objets d’art, puis aux côtés des
    Antiquités orientales.`,

    niche above a theater and also suggest it accompanied
    an altar that was within view of the ship monument of
    Demetrius I Poliorcetes (337–283 BC). Rendered in grey
    and white Thasian and Parian marble, the figure
    originally formed part of the Samothrace temple
    complex dedicated to the Great gods, Megaloi Theoi. It
    stood on a rostral pedestal of gray marble from Lartos
    representing the prow of a ship (most likely a
    trihemiolia), and represents the goddess as she
    descends from the skies to the triumphant fleet.`,

    refers generally to sculpture from Ancient Greece and
    Ancient Rome, as well as the Hellenized and Romanized
    civilizations under their rule or influence, from
    about 500 BC to around 200 AD. It may also refer more
    precisely a period within Ancient Greek sculpture from
    around 500 BC to the onset of the Hellenistic style
    around 323 BC, in this case usually given a capital
    "C".[1] The term "classical" is also widely used for a
    stylistic tendency in later sculpture, not restricted
    to works in a Neoclassical or classical style.`,

    title: 'Sleeping Hermaphrodite On Bed',
    about: `A hermaphrodite, in classical reference, is a female in appearance and swagger who possesses the “bits and pieces” of a male. Ancient Mediterraneans celebrated and sculpted the hermaphrodite as if she/he were a unicorn today. This can be seen in the hoards of statues dedicated to this sexual being created during antiquity. There are many anthropological differences between our societies to explain why a hermaphrodite was so celebrated in the past and forgotten in modern times. The Romans and Greeks sculpted this figure with tremendous care, which is seen in the details.`,

    title: 'La Belle Ferronière',
    about: `Lo sguardo magnetico della dama raffigurata rende questo splendido ritratto femminile una delle opere più importanti di Leonardo, anche se fino ad oggi è stato oscurato dalla fama di altri ritratti leonardeschi come la Gioconda o la Dama con l’Ermellino. Il ritratto, oggi conservato al Louvre di Parigi, venne dipinto durante il primo soggiorno milanese, all’incirca in contemporanea con l’Ultima Cena e successivamente alla dama con l’ermellino. La dama ritratta rappresenta probabilmente una delle favorite del Moro, forse Lucrezia Crivelli o la stessa Cecilia Gallerani (la Dama con l’Ermellino) in età più adulta. Indubbio è comunque il valore del quadro, che si fa notare per l’innovativo taglio della figura e soprattutto, come già detto, per la profondità e il fascino dello sguardo. All’incirca di questi anni è infatti il Trattato di Pittura nel quale Leonardo afferma che "L'occhio è la finestra dell’anima".`,

      [ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛːz]) was a period of radical political
      and societal change in France that began with the
      Estates General of 1789 and ended with the formation
      of the French Consulate in November 1799. Many of its
      ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal
      democracy, while phrases like Liberté, égalité,
      fraternité reappeared in other revolts, such as the
      1917 Russian Revolution, and inspired campaigns for
      the abolition of slavery and universal suffrage. Its
      values and the institutions it created dominate French
      politics to this day.`,
